## Overview

AgreeMate presents a comprehensive finetuning/testing framework and negotiation system that explores LLMs' capabilities in strategic price bargaining. Our approach combines:

- Role-specialized fine-tuning (buyer, seller, generalist)
- Systematic model comparison across scales (3B to 70B parameters)
- Chain of thought prompting
- Personality-driven behavior modeling
- Attention mechanism analysis

### Related Work

Our work builds on [*"Decoupling Strategy and Generation in Negotiation Dialogues"*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09637) by He et al. (2018), which introduced a modular approach to negotiation using coarse dialogue acts for strategy control.

AgreeMate advances this by leveraging LLMs to unify strategy and generation without requiring explicit intermediate representations, enabling more nuanced and scalable negotiation behaviors.

### Key Features

- **Model Variants**: Specialized fine-tuned models for buyer, seller, and generalist roles
- **Multiple Scales**: Support for LLaMA models from 3B to 70B parameters
- **Personality Types**: Configurable negotiation personalities (aggressive, fair, passive)
- **Chain of Thought**: Enhanced reasoning capabilities through CoT prompting
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Novel measurements for fairness, bias, efficiency, and more

### Key Technologies

- Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA
- 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency
- Gradient checkpointing
- Mixed precision training
- Advanced learning rate scheduling

### Results & Findings

- Larger models demonstrate improved agreement rates and fairness
- Chain of Thought prompting enhances exploratory behavior
- Personality traits significantly influence negotiation dynamics
- Attention analysis reveals semantic understanding of negotiation concepts

## Basic Usage

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeneralCoder365/agreemate
cd agreemate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Negotiation

```python
from agreemate import Negotiator

# initialize buyer and seller agents
buyer = Negotiator(role="buyer", model="llama-3.2-3B-buyer")
seller = Negotiator(role="seller", model="llama-3.2-3B-seller")

# run negotiation
dialogue = negotiate(buyer, seller, scenario="car_charger")
```

### Personality Configuration

```python
# create agents with specific personalities
aggressive_buyer = Negotiator(
    role="buyer",
    personality="aggressive",
    model="llama-3.2-3B-buyer"
)

fair_seller = Negotiator(
    role="seller",
    personality="fair",
    model="llama-3.2-3B-seller"
)
```
