The truck is in great condition with no mechanical flaws whatsoever and a clean accident history. Got new tires about 3,000 miles ago. Always has the oil changed on time (due in about 1k). Just got a thorough cleaning inside and a wash and wax outside (still wet in the photos). This truck has never been offroad, but the 4WD is working perfectly from the few times we've been up to Tahoe in it. However, it's a 10+ year old truck that's been driven, not babied and garaged all the time. It's got some scratches, paint is not perfect, but zero body damage.",car,14500.0,8700.0,14500.0,Accepted,8500.0,"	Buyer: I'm really interested in purchasing your 2006 Toyota 4Runner. Can you tell me more about it?
	Seller: The 2006 Toyota 4Runner is a great vehicle, with low maintenance costs and excellent fuel efficiency. It has a clean title and a comprehensive history report. I've maintained it regularly, and it's been garaged most of the time. The previous owner was actually a bit of a nervous driver, which explains the low mileage - only 106k miles on the odometer.
	Buyer: That's great to hear, thank you for sharing the details about the vehicle's history and maintenance. Can you tell me more about the condition of the tires and any signs of wear on the interior and exterior?
	Seller: The tires are actually new, with only about 3,000 miles on them. They're in great condition, with plenty of tread left. As for the interior, I recently gave it a thorough cleaning and the carpet is still looking like new. The exterior has a couple of minor scratches, but nothing major. The paint is a bit scratched in a few places, but overall it's held up really well considering it's over a decade old.
	Buyer: That sounds great, thank you for the detailed information about the vehicle's condition. Speaking of which, I noticed that the mileage is relatively low. You mentioned you've been a regular driver and the previous owner was a nervous driver - how do you think the age and mileage will affect the truck's performance in the future?
	Seller: As for the age and mileage, I think they'll be more of a blessing than a curse. The 4Runner is known for its durability and reliability, and Toyota is a reputable brand. The 106k miles may add a bit of wear and tear, but it's well within the normal range for a vehicle of its age. Additionally, the previous owner's nervous driving habits may have helped to reduce the wear on the vehicle. Overall, I think
	Buyer: I think we've covered all the important points, and I'm really impressed with the vehicle's condition and history. Considering the low mileage and maintenance record, I'm willing to make an offer of $8,400.
	Seller: That's a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the truck. Considering its excellent condition and the low mileage, I think I can do $8,800.

	Seller: The Soundlink 3 features a 3-inch woofer, 2 x 1.5-inch mid-range drivers, and a passive bass port, providing clear and deep bass.
