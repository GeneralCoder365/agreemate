      Negotiation for: <Bose Soundlink 3 brand new>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Bose Soundlink 3 brand new. Can you tell me more about the item and its price?
	Seller: The Bose Soundlink 3 is a high-quality Bluetooth speaker that's perfect for outdoor gatherings or home entertainment. As for the price, I'm asking for $205, considering its brand new condition and minimal usage.
	Buyer: That sounds great, I really like the sound quality of Bose products. However, I was expecting the price to be closer to $120, considering it's a brand new item with minimal usage.
	Seller: Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of $220. The minimal usage and gift condition do impact the price slightly.
	Buyer: I understand the condition and the brand new status, but I was really hoping to get it for closer to $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $170?
	Seller: I can do $210, which is very close to my target price, and I can also throw in some extras, like a carrying case, to sweeten the deal.
	Buyer: I can do $160, that's the lowest I'm willing to go.
	Seller: I can do $200, that's the lowest I can go without losing money on the extras I'm providing.
	Buyer: I can do $185, that's as close as I can get to your target price.
	Seller: I think we're getting close, how about we meet in the middle at $192?

	Seller: The listing price for the 4 cubicles is $400. I'm open to negotiation, though, and I think we can find a fair price that suits both of us.
	Buyer: I was thinking more along the lines of $230. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?
	Seller: I understand where you're coming from, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about we meet at $320?
	Buyer: I can do $270, and that's the lowest I'm comfortable going. It's still within my target range, and I'd like to make a deal.
	Seller: That's a bit lower than I had in mind, but I can see we're getting closer to a fair price. How about we meet at $310?
	Buyer: I can do $260, and that's still within my target range. I think we can finalize the deal at that price.
	Seller: I think we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet at $300?
	Buyer: I can do $260, and that's still within my target range. I think we can finalize the deal at that price.
