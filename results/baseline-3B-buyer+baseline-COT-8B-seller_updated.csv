	Seller: Hi, that's a great board, pretty much brand new, rode only 4 or 5 times. It's a Gravity skateboard deck with Sidewinder 2 trucks, Mini Monster Hawgs, 70mm 78a Wheels, and Swiss Bones bearings.
	Buyer: That sounds like a high-quality board, I can see why you're looking to sell it. Can you tell me more about the condition and any other features that might be worth mentioning?
	Seller: It's in excellent condition, considering it's only been ridden a handful of times. The wheels are brand new, and the bearings are still in their original packaging. I've taken good care of it, and it's been stored in a dry place when not in use.
	Buyer: I'm really impressed by the board's condition and features. I'd like to make an offer of $180, which I think is a fair price considering its quality and the fact that it's barely been used.
	Seller: I appreciate your offer of $180, but I was thinking more along the lines of $195.
	Buyer: I can see why you'd want to get $195 for it, but $180 is my final offer. I think that's a reasonable price considering its condition and that it's only been used a handful of times.
	Seller: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I think $190 would be a more reasonable compromise.
	Buyer: I can go up to $190 for it, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.
	Seller: I can do $192, but I'm not willing to go any higher.
	Buyer: How about $192 for the board?
	Seller: Agreed. $192 works for me.
