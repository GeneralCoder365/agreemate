Can you tell me more about the car?
	Seller: Absolutely, the 2013 Mercedes C250 is a great car with excellent fuel efficiency, impressive handling, and luxurious features. The navigation system is one of its standout features, providing turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates. The interior is also very comfortable, with premium materials and plenty of space for passengers and cargo. The price I'm asking is $12,000, which I believe is a fair market value considering its condition and mileage.
	Buyer: That sounds great, thank you for describing the features and benefits of the car. I've done some research, and I think it's a fantastic vehicle. The price you've listed is also reasonable given the low mileage and excellent condition. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would that be something you'd be willing to consider?
	Seller: I understand where you're coming from, but I think $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd be comfortable selling for. Considering the low mileage and the full package of options, I was thinking more in the range of $11,200, which is still a great deal considering the car's overall condition and value.

	Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm close to your target price. However, I can go up to $10,900, and that would make me very comfortable with the sale.
	Seller: I think we're getting close to a deal, how about $11,000?
	Buyer: I'd be happy to meet you at $10,700, and I think that's a fair compromise considering the low mileage and excellent condition of the car.

      Negotiation for: <2013 mercedes c250 *navigation* clean - $12,000>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the 2013 Mercedes C250 with navigation, clean title, and all the additional options you mentioned. Can you tell me more about the car?
	Seller: Absolutely, the 2013 Mercedes C250 is a great car with excellent fuel efficiency, impressive handling, and luxurious features. The navigation system is one of its standout features, providing turn-by-turn directions and real-time traffic updates. The interior is also very comfortable, with premium materials and plenty of space for passengers and cargo. The price I'm asking is $12,000, which I believe is a fair market value considering its condition and mileage.
	Buyer: That sounds great, thank you for describing the features and benefits of the car. I've done some research, and I think it's a fantastic vehicle. The price you've listed is also reasonable given the low mileage and excellent condition. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would that be something you'd be willing to consider?
	Seller: I understand where you're coming from, but I think $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd be comfortable selling for. Considering the low mileage and the full package of options, I was thinking more in the range of $11,200, which is still a great deal considering the car's overall condition and value.
	Buyer: That's a bit above my target, but I can see why you'd want to get a good price for the car. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,800?
	Seller: I can see that you're willing to stretch a bit, but I'm still not quite there. I could do $11,000, and that would be a fair compromise considering the low mileage and excellent condition of the car.
	Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm close to your target price. However, I can go up to $10,900, and that would make me very comfortable with the sale.
	Seller: I think we're getting close to a deal, how about $11,000?
	Buyer: I'd be happy to meet you at $10,700, and I think that's a fair compromise considering the low mileage and excellent condition of the car.
	Seller: I think $10,850 would be a fair deal considering the car's condition and value.
	Buyer: I think we're close, but I'd rather meet you in the middle at $10,900.
	Seller: I can do $10,900, and that would be a great deal considering the car's condition, mileage, and all the additional options.

	Seller: Yeah, it's a great car. As I mentioned, it has 120k miles, but it's been well maintained. I've had it serviced every 3,500 miles, and I've recently installed a JWT clutch and flywheel, a K&N long tube cold air intake, and new Michelin A/S sport plus tires. It's also been lowered on Tein springs, which gives it a pretty aggressive look.
	Buyer: That sounds like a great car, and it's clear you've put a lot of work into it. Can you tell me more about its condition and any other upgrades or features it has?
	Seller: Actually, one more thing. I've also installed a 5/16 motordyne spacer kit, which can give the engine a bit more power.
	Buyer: That's really impressive, I can see why you're selling it because it's not what you're looking for.
	Seller: By the way, I'm a bit open to negotiating the price since I'm looking for a work truck, so let's talk about that.
	Buyer: Hi, thanks for sharing all the details about the car. It sounds like a real head-turner. I can see why you'd want to sell it for a good price. Can you tell me, what's your target price for the car now that you're looking for a work truck?
	Seller: I'm really glad you're interested in the car. As for my target price, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've already priced it competitively, and I feel it's a fair value considering its condition, upgrades, and low mileage.
	Buyer: I think that's a reasonable price, but I was hoping to get it for around 8175, considering the car is just being sold because it's not what you're looking for.
	Seller: I think I can work with that. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?
	Buyer: I think that's a fair compromise, but I'd be willing to go up to $8,250.
	Seller: I can do $8,375, which is still within my target price range, but I'm willing to meet you halfway to make it a fair deal.

      Negotiation for: <Bottom Floor, 2 Bd/2 Bth, Large Patio! Close to downtown, W.C. area!>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: Hi, I'm very interested in the Bottom Floor, 2 Bd/2 Bth, Large Patio! Close to downtown, W.C. area! Can you tell me more about the price?
	Seller: The listing price for this apartment is 2250.00, but since it's currently vacant, I can offer you a special deal.
	Buyer: That sounds like a great deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of 1900. Can we meet in the middle at 2125?
	Seller: I can see why you'd think that way, but we can definitely do better than that. How about I meet you halfway at 2175?
	Buyer: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of 2100, and I'm not sure 2175 would be too far out of my budget.
	Seller: I see you're trying to find a balance between our offers. I can understand that 2100 is a bit closer to your target price, but I'd need a bit more room to make it work for me. How about we try 2130?
	Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at 2100, but I can do 2110. Is that something we can work with?
	Seller: I think we're getting close, and I'm willing to meet you at 2120, but that's as low as I can go.
	Buyer: I think we're really close, and I'd feel comfortable agreeing to 2115.
	Seller: Eh, fine. 2115 it is then.
