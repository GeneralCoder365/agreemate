	Seller: Yes, it's a great car, low mileage, runs well, and has a clean title. The 6.2L V8 engine is smooth and powerful.

Can you tell me a bit about its condition and any maintenance it's had?
	Seller: The bike is in great condition, considering its age, with minimal wear on the components and overall, it's been well-maintained. I've had it serviced regularly, and it's been stored in a dry environment to keep it in good shape.

Can you tell me more about the condition of the tires, such as their tread life and any wear on the sidewalls?
	Seller: The tires are in excellent condition, with about 80% of their original tread life remaining. The sidewalls show no significant wear or damage, and they've been rotated regularly to ensure even wear. The rim tapes are also in good condition, and the wheels have been inspected quarterly to ensure they're free from any damage or issues.

      Negotiation for: <4 Cubicles for Sale>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the 4 cubicles you have listed. Can you tell me more about them?
	Seller: Yes, they're a great set of cubicles, perfect for home offices or small businesses. Each cubicle measures 47 inches high, 72 inches wide, and 72 inches deep. They're sturdy and well-made, with plenty of space for your equipment and furniture. I've priced them at $400 for the set of 4.
	Buyer: I'm impressed with their size and quality, but I was thinking more along the lines of $280 for the set of 4.
	Seller: I can see you're a savvy buyer, but I'm afraid I won't be able to go down to $280. The market value for this set is still around $400, considering the quality and space provided. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $350?
	Buyer: I'm willing to meet you at $320, but I'd like to know if there's a bit more room for negotiation.
	Seller: I think $320 is a bit too high, considering the market value. I can do $330, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.
	Buyer: I'm willing to meet you at $318, but that's my final offer.
	Seller: I can do $325, but that's the lowest I'm comfortable with.
	Buyer: I can meet you at $315.
	Seller: I can do $320, but that's the lowest I'm willing to go.
	Buyer: I can do $315, and I'm willing to throw in a free ergonomic chair to sweeten the deal.
