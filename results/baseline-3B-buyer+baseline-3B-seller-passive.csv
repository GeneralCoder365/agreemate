	Seller: The Bose Soundlink 3 is a brand new, never used speaker that I got as a gift but I'm actually using a Sonos system, it's in excellent condition and has all the original accessories.
	Buyer: That sounds great, thank you for the detailed description. However, I was wondering if you could tell me more about the price, it's listed at $220, which is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay.
	Seller: Actually, I was thinking more along the lines of $200, considering it's brand new and I'm willing to sell it as is.
	Buyer: I'm willing to go up to $180, is that something you'd be open to negotiating on?
	Seller: I can do $210, but that's as low as I can go considering my target price is a bit higher than the market value.
	Buyer: I'm thinking more along the lines of $160, would you be willing to meet me in the middle?
	Seller: I can do $205, but I'd need to meet you halfway next time we discuss the price.

	Seller: It's listed for $200.00, but I'm open to negotiations.
	Buyer: Would you be willing to consider $180? That's a bit closer to the price I was hoping for.
	Seller: I think we can do $190, but that's as low as I can go.
	Buyer: I was thinking more along the lines of $185, would that be something we can work with?
	Seller: I can do $190, but only because I think the build is worth the price. Is $185 still something you'd be interested in?
	Buyer: I'd be very interested in the long board, and $185 seems like a great price considering the quality of the build.
	Seller: I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, so I'd say $190.
	Buyer: Eh, fine. $185.
