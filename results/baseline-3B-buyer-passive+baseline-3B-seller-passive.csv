	Seller: Yes, it's compatible with most standard micro USB devices, including iPhones, Samsung Galaxy phones, and other Android devices. However, I do want to note that this charger is specifically designed to charge two devices at once, so you won't be able to charge them simultaneously if they both require different charging speeds.

      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in the Bose Soundlink 3. Can you tell me more about it?
	Seller: Yes, it's a brand new, never used Bose Soundlink 3. I got it as a gift but I've decided to go with a different setup for my home audio system.
	Buyer: That's great, it's a fantastic product with excellent sound quality. Can you tell me a bit more about why you're looking to sell it?
	Seller: I just really like the sound quality and I think it would make a great addition to someone else's home setup. I've also got a Sonos system that I'm using, so I don't really need it anymore.
	Buyer: That's great, can you tell me more about the condition of the Bose Soundlink 3? Is it still in the packaging and all the original accessories are included?
	Seller: Yes, it's still in the packaging and all the original accessories are included, which should include a USB cable, a charging cable, and a carrying case.
	Buyer: Actually, the Bose Soundlink 3 is a great product for outdoor use, with its water and dust resistance, which is one of the reasons I've been wanting to keep it for my camping trips.
	Seller: Actually, you might be surprised to know that it does have that feature, being water and dust resistant, so it could be a great option for your camping trips.
	Buyer: The Bose Soundlink 3 is a fantastic product, and I think it's worth considering for my camping trips. Considering its brand new condition and all the original accessories included, I was thinking more along the lines of $120.
	Seller: Eh, fine. $120.

      	Buyer: I'm willing to go up to eighty dollars, but I think eighty is still a bit high.
	Seller: I can see why you'd think that, but considering the car's condition and the rarity of the ZL1 rims, I'd say my price of sixty is a fair one.
	Buyer: I can do seventy-five, considering the car's condition and the value of the rims.
	Seller: That's a good compromise, I can see why you'd think my price is reasonable considering the car's condition. How about seventy?
	Buyer: I think seventy's a bit closer, but I was thinking more along the lines of seventy-five.
	Seller: I can see why you'd lean towards seventy-five, but I've gotta consider my target price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at seventy-five?
	Buyer: I can do seventy-two, but I'm almost at my target price, so I'd prefer to stay below it.
	Seller: That's a fair compromise, I can see why you'd lean towards seventy-five, but I've gotta consider my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at seventy, but I'd like to also consider my target price. How about we say seventy-five minus a little something?
	Buyer: I think seventy-two is a reasonable deal.

      	Buyer: Hi, I saw the listing for the 4-bedroom single-family house in central Fremont and I'm very interested in it. I was wondering if there's any room for negotiation on the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $2,400.

Can you tell me more about it and what you're looking for in terms of a sale?
	Seller: This MASI 3V Volumetrica CCCP 1990 is a high-quality, brand-new bike that's in excellent condition. It's been well-maintained and comes with original accessories. As for a sale, I'm open to reasonable offers, but I'm looking to get at least $3,000 for it, considering its rarity and condition.
	Buyer: That sounds great, I've done some research and I see that a similar model can sell for around $2,700. Would you be willing to consider a price around that range?
	Seller: I appreciate your research, but I can see why you'd think that, the market can fluctuate, and this particular model is quite unique. Considering its condition, rarity, and original accessories, I'd say $3,200 is a fair price.
	Buyer: I understand where you're coming from, and I can appreciate the unique features of this bike. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $2,200, considering the market price you mentioned earlier and the bike's condition.
	Seller: Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $2,700?
	Buyer: That's a good compromise, but I can do $2,250.
	Seller: I was thinking more around $2,800, considering the bike's condition and original accessories.
	Buyer: That's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I can do $2,250, and I'll make it a firm offer this time.
	Seller: I can see we're close, but not quite there. I'd be willing to meet you at $2,600, and that's as high as I can go.
	Buyer: I can do $2,300, and I'll throw in an additional discount since it's a firm offer.
	Seller: I'll match your offer of $2,300 and throw in the original accessories for an added $100 discount.
	Buyer: That sounds great, I'll accept your offer of $2,300 and I'm excited to get this bike.

	Seller: The TREK JET 20 S is a great bike for kids around that age, it's designed to be easy to handle and perfect for kids who are just starting to learn how to ride. It has a single-speed mechanism, which makes it perfect for little ones who are still getting the hang of pedaling. The bike itself is very sturdy and should fit a child between 5-10 years old depending on their height.
	Buyer: That sounds great, I appreciate the information. So, just to confirm, this bike is normally priced at $100.00, but I was wondering if you'd be willing to negotiate the price for me since I'm buying it for a child?
	Seller: Yes, of course, I'd be happy to discuss the price with you. We're actually looking to sell this bike for $100.
	Buyer: I think $76 would be a fair price considering you're aware of the normal price and I'm buying it for my child, don't you think?
	Seller: I think $90 would be a reasonable price considering the bike is still in good condition and I'm buying it for my child.
	Buyer: I understand where you're coming from, but I think $76 is still a bit low. Would you be willing to consider $88?
	Seller: I could do $87, but that's as much as I'm willing to come down.
	Buyer: I understand, I can meet you at $85.
	Seller: Eh, fine, $85 is a good price, I think we have an agreement.
	Buyer: Sounds good, I'll take it for $85.
