Can you tell me a bit more about the price?
	Seller: We're asking $15 for these specifically designed wireless headphones, but I can give you a good deal since you're interested.
	Buyer: That's a bit higher than I was expecting, but I do love the sound quality and design. Can you tell me more about what sets these apart from other wireless headphones on the market?
	Seller: Ah, the Sol Republic Wireless Bluetooth Headphones are equipped with A2 Sound Engines, delivering clear highs and detailed deep bass - setting them apart from other wireless headphones in terms of sound quality. The Super-Power Wireless technology allows for control tracks to be controlled from up to 150 feet away, giving you unparalleled freedom.
	Buyer: I'm looking for a price point closer to $93. Considering the advanced sound engine and long-range wireless capabilities, I'd expect this product to be competitively priced.
	Seller: I understand where you're coming from, but $93 is still a bit out of our range. However, I can see why you'd think that given the features. Let's meet in the middle at $120.
	Buyer: I'm still a bit above my comfort zone at $120; how about we compromise at $100?
	Seller: I can see where you're coming from, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I can do $105, and that's as low as I can go.
	Buyer: I'm still a bit above my comfort zone, but I'd be willing to meet you at $100, and I'd like to throw in a deal if you're willing to meet me there.
	Seller: I can meet you at $100, but I'd like to make it a deal. If you're willing to buy now, I'll throw in a free extra pair of wireless headphones, perfect for sharing with friends or for replacement if the first pair ever gets damaged.
	Buyer: How about I meet you exactly at $93?
	Seller: I can meet you exactly at $105, that's the lowest I can go.

	Seller: Yeah, it's still available for $8900. I've had several people interested, but I'm open to negotiations.
