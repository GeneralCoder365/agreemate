      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in the DJI Mavic Pro batteries. I see they're listed at $150. Can we discuss a price? My target price would be around $114.
	Seller: I can see you've done your research, but I was thinking more along the lines of $137, considering they're gently used and I need to maintain a profit margin.
	Buyer: I can do $121.
	Seller: I can see you're trying to meet your target price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $128.
	Buyer: I'd be more comfortable if it was $125.
	Seller: How about $130?
	Buyer: Can you do $126?
	Seller: I can see we're getting closer, but I can do $127.
	Buyer: $127 is still a bit off. How about $124?
	Seller: I think we're almost there. I can do $126 for you.
	Buyer: I'd be willing to go up to $126, but how about you meet me halfway at $125.5?
