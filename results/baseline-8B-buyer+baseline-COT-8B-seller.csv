	Seller: This TREK JET 20 S is a single-speed bike designed for kids aged 5-10 years old, depending on their height. It's perfect for young riders to learn balance and have fun riding.
	Buyer: That sounds great, it perfectly fits my child's age and height.
	Seller: Since it fits your child's height, they'll likely have a comfortable ride, and the single-speed design is great for learning balance and coordination.
	Buyer: That's excellent to know. The single-speed option will be suitable for my child as they begin to learn how to ride a bike.
	Seller: I can sell it for $12. What do you think?
	Buyer: I think it's a bit more than I'd like to pay. Would you go for $9 instead?
	Seller: I can't do $9, but how about $10.50 instead?
	Buyer: I think the lowest I would want to go is $9.50.
	Seller: I can do $10, it's the closest I can get to $10.50 without going below your target price.
	Buyer: Can't you go a bit lower at $9.50?
	Seller: I can see you're really interested in the bike, and I want to make a deal. How about $10.25 instead?
	Buyer: I can do $9.75.
	Seller: I can see you're really interested in the bike, and I want to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $10.075?
	Buyer: I think $9.50 is the absolute lowest I can go.
