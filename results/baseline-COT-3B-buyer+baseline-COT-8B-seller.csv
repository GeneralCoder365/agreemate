	Seller: The 2016 Raleigh Kodiak II is a used bike, but it's well-maintained and has been thoroughly cleaned and serviced. I've taken good care of it, and it has a full set of upgrades as described in the listing.
	Buyer: That's great to hear. Since it's a used bike with upgrades, I'd like to know if the seller is open to considering a lower price based on its age. Are you willing to negotiate the price based on its condition?
	Seller: Yes, the bike's age is a factor, but the upgrades and maintenance I've done have increased its value. I'm open to discussion, but I'd like to start the negotiation at the listing price of $2000.
	Buyer: I understand that the bike has been well-maintained, and the upgrades add value. However, considering its age and the market value of similar bikes, I'd like to propose a price of $1700.
	Seller: I appreciate your offer, but I think $1700 is a bit low considering the upgrades and maintenance I've done. How about we meet in the middle at $1900?
	Buyer: I'm still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1850.

Is it new or used?
	Seller: The item is a pre-owned 2 Bedroom, 1 Bath unit, but it's been well-maintained and is in good condition.
	Buyer: That's great to hear! Given the unit's condition, I was thinking more along the lines of adjusting the price based on the pre-owned status. Would you be willing to consider a discount of $200-$300?
	Seller: I can consider a discount, but how about $250 off the listing price, and we meet in the middle at $2000?
	Buyer: I can meet you in the middle at $1950.
	Seller: I can do $2050, but that's the lowest I can go.
	Buyer: I think $1950 is a fair price considering the unit's condition and the discount you're offering. I'm willing to accept that.
	Seller: I understand your perspective, but $1950 is still $300 below the listing price and the discount we previously discussed. I was thinking more along the lines of $2025.
	Buyer: I think $1950 is a fair price considering the unit's condition and the discount you're offering. I'm willing to accept that.
