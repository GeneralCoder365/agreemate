      	Buyer: Hi, I saw the listing for the 4-bedroom single-family house in central Fremont and I'm very interested in it. I was wondering if there's any room for negotiation on the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $2,400.
	Seller: I appreciate your interest in the house, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $3,100, considering its excellent condition and great location.
	Buyer: That's a bit higher than I was expecting, but I'm still keen on making an offer. I could do $2,500.
	Seller: I can do $2,800, and that's as high as I'm willing to go.
	Buyer: I can do $2,600, would that be acceptable to you?
	Seller: That's still a bit below my target, but I can meet you in the middle at $2,700.
	Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $2,500. Is that something we can work with?
	Seller: I think we're close, but I can do $2,700. Would that work for you?
	Buyer: Eh, $2,600 seems reasonable.
	Seller: Sounds like we've reached a fair agreement. I think $2,600 is a reasonable price for the house.

      	Buyer: I'm really interested in the long board custom bilt from the board up, and I was thinking more along the lines of $175. Is that something you'd be open to discussing?
	Seller: Considering the original price was $200.0 and it's a long board custom built from the board up, I think $175 is a bit too low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway, something around $187.5.
	Buyer: I can do $185, that's the lowest I can go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.
	Seller: I can do $188.5, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.
	Buyer: That's a bit closer, but I was thinking more like $183.
	Seller: I can do $189, that's the closest I can get to your offer.
	Buyer: I can do $187, but that's the absolute lowest I can go.
	Seller: I can do $188, that's close to my target price.
	Buyer: Eh, fine. $187 sounds reasonable.
