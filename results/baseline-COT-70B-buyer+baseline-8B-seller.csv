	Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600. Could you meet me in the middle at that price?
	Seller: I can do $1750.
	Buyer: I understand we're getting closer, but I was hoping we could meet at $1650, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer but shows I'm willing to compromise.
	Seller: I can do $1700.
	Buyer: I'm willing to pay $1675, which is slightly higher than my previous offer, considering we're close to an agreement.
	Seller: I could do $1670.
	Buyer: $1670 sounds like a fair price. I'm willing to accept it.
