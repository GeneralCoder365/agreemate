Saddle is on my Cannondale. It was turned up about 25 miles of riding ago.,bike,600.0,456.0,600.0,Rejected,,"	Buyer: Can you tell me more about the condition and history of this Steel Frame Colnago?
	Seller: The Steel Frame Colnago was made and designed for the tall/large man, features Campanella components, and has a saddle that's not currently on the frame - it's actually on my Cannondale.
	Buyer: That's great to know. It sounds like you've taken good care of the frame. Can you tell me more about the condition of the frame itself?
	Seller: The frame itself is in excellent condition, considering it was turned up about 25 miles of riding ago. The steel frame has held up remarkably well, and there are no major scratches or dents. The Campanella components are also in great condition, with no signs of wear or damage.
	Buyer: That's fantastic to hear, given its age. Since it's been used only 25 miles, can you tell me more about the rider's style and how it was ridden?
	Seller: To be honest, I don't have specific information about the rider's style or how the bike was ridden. It was turned up by someone else, and I only recently acquired it. However, I can tell you that it was stored properly after the 25 miles of riding, and the frame has been well-maintained overall.
	Buyer: That's good to know, and I appreciate the information about the condition and history of the frame. However, I'm more interested in the current situation - you're looking to sell it for $600, which is above my target price. Can we discuss possible alternatives?
	Seller: I'm willing to consider alternatives, but I was thinking more along the lines of $575, considering the frame's condition and the fact that it's been used only 25 miles. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that.
	Buyer: With the frame's condition being excellent and its relatively low mileage, I'm willing to make you a counteroffer of $450.
	Seller: I can do $525, a bit closer to my target price, but I'm still committed to selling it to you.

	Buyer: That sounds like a great product. I'm particularly interested in the wheels and bearings, as I've had issues with durability in the past. Can you tell me more about the condition of the wheels and whether they've been used at all?
