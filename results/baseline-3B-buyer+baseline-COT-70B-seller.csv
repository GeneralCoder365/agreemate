	Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14800 seems a bit high for a 2010 model with 120 miles on it. My target price is closer to $11248. Would you be willing to consider that?
	Seller: I understand your concern about the price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000, considering the car's condition and the upgrades it has.
	Buyer: I can see why you'd think that, but for a used car with high mileage, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000, considering the recent maintenance and the fact that you've only put 120 miles on it.
	Seller: I can see your point, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13800, considering the car's excellent condition, the ZL1 rims, and the recent maintenance.
	Buyer: I can see why you'd think $13800 is reasonable, but I can do $12900.
	Seller: I can see you're a serious buyer, but I can do $13500, considering the car's condition and the upgrades.
	Buyer: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can do $13200.
	Seller: I think $13200 is a fair price, I accept your offer.

Please no low ballers thank you and have a great day .,bike,200.0,184.0,200.0,Accepted,180.0,"	Buyer: Hi there, I'm really interested in that custom long board you have for sale. Can you tell me more about it?
	Seller: It's a custom-built long board with a Gravity skateboard deck, Sidewinder 2 trucks, and 70mm 78a Wheels with Swiss Bones bearings, which are brand new. I've only ridden it 4 or 5 times, so it's pretty much brand new.
	Buyer: That sounds great, can you tell me more about the condition of the bearings and the deck?
	Seller: The bearings are brand new Swiss Bones, and the deck is in excellent condition, with no scratches or damage, still has that new look and feel.
	Buyer: It sounds like you've taken great care of it. Considering it's brand new with almost no use, I'd say a fair price would be $160.
	Seller: I appreciate your interest, but I was thinking more along the lines of $195, considering the high-quality components and the fact that it's barely been used.
	Buyer: I think that's a bit steep, but considering it's a high-quality long board, I'd be willing to go up to $172.
	Seller: I understand where you're coming from, but I was thinking more along the lines of $185. It's a great price considering the brand new bearings and the excellent condition of the deck.
	Buyer: How about we meet in the middle at $177?
	Seller: I can see we're close, but I'd like to counter with $182, considering the value of the components and the condition of the board.
	Buyer: I think we can meet at $180.
	Seller: $180 sounds like a fair price to me, I'm willing to accept that.
