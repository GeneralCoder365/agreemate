Just got a thorough cleaning inside and a wash and wax outside (still wet in the photos). This truck has never been offroad, but the 4WD is working perfectly from the few times we've been up to Tahoe in it. However, it's a 10+ year old truck that's been driven, not babied and garaged all the time. It's got some scratches, paint is not perfect, but zero body damage.",car,14500.0,8700.0,14500.0,Rejected,N/A,"	Buyer: I'm really interested in purchasing your 2006 Toyota 4Runner.

It's got a strong 4WD system and is perfect for those occasional off-road trips. The interior is clean and tidy, with no signs of excessive wear. Overall, it's a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable and capable vehicle.
