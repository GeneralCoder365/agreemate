      Negotiation for: <Long board custom bilt from the board up>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: Hi there, I'm really interested in the long board custom build from Gravity Skateboard. The combination of sidewinder 2 trucks, mini monster hawgs, and Swiss bones bearings sounds awesome. Can you tell me more about it?
	Seller: Yeah, it's a really high-quality setup. I've had it for about 4 or 5 times, and it's been well taken care of. The deck itself is in great condition, and the trucks and wheels are brand new. I've only ridden it a handful of times, so it's still got a lot of life left in it.
	Buyer: That sounds great, I'd love to take a closer look. I was thinking of offering $160 for the board, considering it's still in great condition and the components are brand new.
	Seller: I was thinking of getting $198 for it, considering the quality of the build and the fact that it's a gravity skateboard, but I'm open to negotiations.
	Buyer: That's a good starting point, I'm willing to go up to $175 for the board.
	Seller: How about $190, considering the quality and the fact that I'd be passing the savings on to you.
