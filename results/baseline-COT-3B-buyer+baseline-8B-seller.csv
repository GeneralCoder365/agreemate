The fact that the frame is in good condition and the saddle is on a different bike is a plus. However, the price of $600 seems a bit steep considering its age and the fact that it's been stored for a while. Could you help me understand why
	Seller: The condition of the bike is one factor, but the rarity and classic design of the Steel Frame Colnago also justify the price.
	Buyer: I can see why you'd want to charge a premium for the Colnago's design and rarity, but I still feel that $600 is a bit steep. Based on the bike's condition and its age, I'd be willing to offer $500, which is a compromise between the price you're asking and my budget.
	Seller: I can do $550, but that's as low as I can go.
	Buyer: I can do $525.
	Seller: I can do $525, but that's as low as I can go.
