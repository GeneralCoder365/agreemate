      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in the Smartphone Leather Belt Holster. Can we discuss the price?
	Seller: I'm open to negotiations, but I was thinking of selling it for $30. It's a high-quality leather holster with a felt-lined interior and a solid metal clip, so I think it's a fair price.
	Buyer: That sounds like a great product, but $30 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $20.
	Seller: I understand your budget concerns, but I can only go as low as $25, considering the quality and features of the holster.
	Buyer: How about $22?
	Seller: I can see you're really interested, but I can do $24 at the lowest, considering the materials and craftsmanship that went into this holster.
	Buyer: I'll meet you in the middle at $23.
	Seller: $23 sounds good to me.
