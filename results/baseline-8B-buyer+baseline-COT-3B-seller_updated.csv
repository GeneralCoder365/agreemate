      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in buying the 2016 Raleigh Kodiak II 27.5. Based on my research, I was thinking of offering $1520.
	Seller: I can do $1800, but I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to make a small compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1650?
	Buyer: $1550 is as high as I can go.
	Seller: I can meet you at $1600, but that's as close as I can get to $1650.
	Buyer: I can give you an additional $10, so how about $1610?
	Seller: I can go up to $1625, close to your offer.
	Buyer: I can give you another $5, so how about $1615?
	Seller: I can do $1620, and that's the best I can do.
	Buyer: I can go up to $1615, that's my final offer.

	Seller: I can do $2850, but that's the lowest I can go considering the effort and resources I've invested in maintaining this rare bike.
	Buyer: I can do $2730.
	Seller: Considering its rarity and condition, I was thinking more along the lines of $3200, but I can see you're trying to negotiate, so I'll start with $3000. This gives us room for some flexibility while still maintaining a premium price for this unique item.
	Buyer: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $3000, how about $2700?
	Seller: I can do $3100, which is a bit higher than my initial price, but considering the back-and-forth negotiation, I think it's a fair compromise.
	Buyer: I'd be willing to go up to $2620.
	Seller: I can see you're trying to drive the price down, but considering the effort and resources I've invested in maintaining this bike, I'm willing to meet in the middle at $3050.
	Buyer: $2580.
