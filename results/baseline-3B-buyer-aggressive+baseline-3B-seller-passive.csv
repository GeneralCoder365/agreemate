	Buyer: That sounds good, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I've seen similar products in the market for around $93.
	Seller: Considering the market value, I can offer them to you for $127.
	Buyer: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'll meet you halfway - I'm willing to pay $120.
	Seller: I can see you're a savvy shopper, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering we're already halfway there, I can meet you at $125.
	Buyer: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I think we can get to a compromise at $115.
	Seller: I think we've gotten pretty close to a mutually agreeable price. How about we aim for $122?

	Seller: I think we're really close to a deal at $122. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?
	Buyer: I appreciate the effort to meet me at $122, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105, considering the market value.
	Seller: Considering we're really close to a deal, I think $125 is a fair price for these great headphones.
	Buyer: I appreciate the effort to meet me at $122, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105, considering the market value, can you do any better than that?

	Buyer: I'm looking for a better deal, can you really sell them for that price?
	Seller: I can do $350, it's a fair price considering their condition and the value they can bring to your office.
	Buyer: I'm thinking more along the lines of $320, considering their size and the fact that they're 4 cubicles together.
	Seller: I can see what you mean about the price, but I think $322 is a bit more reasonable considering the space they take up and the overall value they'll add to your office.
	Buyer: I can see where you're coming from, but $322 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $280, considering the space and value they'll bring to my office.
	Seller: I can see you're a savvy negotiator, and I respect that. However, I'm still attached to the price of $322. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $315?
	Buyer: I can do $305.
	Seller: I think we can find a good balance there, how about we meet in the middle at $310?
	Buyer: I can do $305, but I'll need you to be more flexible on the price.
	Seller: I think we can do $307.5, considering the value they bring to your office.
	Buyer: I can do $298.
	Seller: Eh, fine. $298.
