      	Buyer: I’m interested in the 1 bedroom home, would you consider 1700?
	Seller: I appreciate your interest, but 1700 is a bit lower than I was expecting, how about 2834?
	Buyer: I understand that 2834 is the listing price, but I was thinking more along the lines of 2000, considering the current market conditions.
	Seller: I understand your concerns about the market, but I can maybe do 2600, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with.
	Buyer: Would you be willing to meet me at 2200, taking into account the amenities and location of the property?
	Seller: I can see you like the amenities and location, but 2200 is still a bit low, how about 2450?
	Buyer: I'm willing to go up to 2300, considering the amenities and location are nice, but the price needs to be more competitive.
	Seller: I can see we're close, but I'd like to discuss 2380 as a potential compromise.
	Buyer: Could you do 2320 instead?
	Seller: 2320 is a reasonable offer, I accept.

	Buyer: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, could you do 10250?
	Seller: I can see you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm firm on 10750, it's the lowest price I can offer while ensuring the car's value is respected.
	Buyer: Considering your firmness on 10750, I could potentially go up to 10500, but that's as high as I'm willing to stretch.
	Seller: I appreciate your willingness to stretch to 10500, but I'm still a bit above that, how about 10600?
	Buyer: I'm getting closer to my limit, could you do 10400?
	Seller: I'm willing to make a final adjustment, how about 10550?
	Buyer: I can see we're very close, but I was thinking more along the lines of 10300.
	Seller: I think we've negotiated a fair price, 10500 is very close to my last offer, but considering your last offer of 10300 is still lower, I'll meet you at 10400 to finalize the deal, however since you previously mentioned 10500 I will take that as the final offer.
