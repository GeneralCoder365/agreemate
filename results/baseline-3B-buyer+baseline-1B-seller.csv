      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in the KONA woman's bicycle with panniers. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
	Seller: Great, I'd be happy to tell you more about it. It's a KONA woman's bicycle with panniers, and it includes two Jandd panniers, Kryptonite lock, Shimano Deore gear shifts with 9 settings, bell, and mirror. It's a great bike for city shopping and short trips, and it's a great option for anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable bike. The listing price is $200
	Buyer: That sounds like a great bike, I'm really interested in it. The price of $200 seems a bit steep for what I'm looking to spend. Can you tell me more about why you're asking that price?
	Seller: Thanks for the detailed specs. I understand you're looking for a reliable bike for city shopping and short trips. What's the story behind the Shimano Deore gear shifts?
	Buyer: Thanks for sharing more info about the bike. The Shimano Deore gear shifts are great for city shopping and short trips, but I was thinking, for a bike of this quality, could we discuss a price slightly lower than $200?
	Seller: I completely understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. As for the Shimano Deore gear shifts, I can see why you'd want them, but I'm originally looking for a slightly more affordable option. For a bike like this, I think the price is reflective of the quality and features it includes. How about we meet in the middle at $195?
