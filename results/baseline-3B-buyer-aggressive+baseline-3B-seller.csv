      Negotiation for: <Bose Soundlink 3 brand new>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the Bose Soundlink 3 brand new. Can you tell me more about the item and its price?
	Seller: The Bose Soundlink 3 is a wireless Bluetooth speaker that's brand new, never used, and comes with a gift. It's a high-quality item that can play clear and powerful audio up to 8 hours.
	Buyer: That sounds great, I'm interested in purchasing it. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $99. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?
	Seller: Unfortunately, I was thinking more along the lines of $220 for it, as it's a brand new item in pristine condition, still has the tags attached.
	Buyer: I can see why you'd want $220 for it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132, considering it's brand new and still has the tags attached.
	Seller: I can do $200 for it, considering the high-quality condition and the gift that came with it.
	Buyer: I'm still a bit short, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $175.
	Seller: I can do $200 for it, considering the high-quality condition and the gift that came with it.
	Buyer: I'm still willing to pay $175, but I think we can do better than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $180?
	Seller: I can do $195 for it.
	Buyer: I'm still a bit short from your end, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $180.

      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in purchasing the Sol Republic Wireless Bluetooth Headphones. Can you tell me a bit more about the price?
	Seller: The Sol Republic Wireless Bluetooth Headphones are actually listed at $155.
	Buyer: That's a bit higher than I was expecting. Are there any discounts available for bulk purchases or promotions that could bring the price down?
	Seller: Actually, we do have a promotion currently going on, where we're offering a 10% discount for first-time buyers. However, I can also offer you an additional 5% off if you're willing to make a decision within the next 5 minutes.
	Buyer: I can pay $98 for them, but I'd like to explore the promotion further.
	Seller: Let me just check a few things. The 10% discount is already applied to the original price, so it would be $155 * 0.9, which is $139.05. Adding the additional 5% off would bring the price down to $139.05 * 0.95, which is $132.42.
	Buyer: I'd like to make an offer of $127, considering the discounts.
	Seller: I can meet you at $130, that's the lowest I can go.
	Buyer: I can do $128, that's my final offer.
	Seller: I can do $125, is that acceptable to you?
	Buyer: I'm afraid $125 is still a bit short of my target price. I was thinking more along the lines of $95, considering the discounts you've offered.
	Seller: How about $130? I think that's the sweet spot considering the discounts we've discussed.
	Buyer: I can do $128, that's the closest I can get to $95.
	Seller: I think we're close, how about $128?
	Buyer: I can do $129, that's the closest I can get to $95.

	Seller: Hi, I'm glad you're interested in the iPhone 7 Plus. I'm looking at a price of $780, but I can do $780 if you're willing to make a decision today.
	Buyer: I'm looking to spend around $700 for this phone, considering its age and the similar prices on the market. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $715?
