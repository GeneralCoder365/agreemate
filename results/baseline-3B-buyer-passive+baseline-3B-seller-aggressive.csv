      	Buyer: Hi, I'm really interested in the Panasonic DVD Player. Could you tell me more about its condition and any flaws it may have?
	Seller: The Panasonic DVD Player is in excellent condition with no blemishes, scratches or dents. Looks and operates as if new.
	Buyer: That's great to hear. Based on your description, I think it's a good match for my needs. Can you tell me more about the price you're looking to sell it for?
	Seller: The price I'm asking for this DVD player is $55, considering its excellent condition and like-new appearance.
	Buyer: I think the Panasonic DVD Player is a great find, but $55 is a bit above my budget for this type of item. Would you be willing to consider an offer of $45?
	Seller: I can do $52 and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I've already priced it competitively, and I think the condition and features it offers warrant that price.
	Buyer: That's a fair offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $48. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though.

      Negotiation for: <SMARTPHONE LEATHER BELT HOLSTER>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: Hi there, I'm really interested in the smartphone leather belt holster. Can you tell me more about it?
	Seller: Yes, it's a high-quality textured leather belt holster that's big enough to fit most smartphones, features a felt-lined interior for protection, a solid metal clip, and a magnetic latch for easy on and off. The interior is also oil-resistant and wipe clean.
	Buyer: That sounds very nice, are you open to negotiations on the price since it seems to be a premium product?
	Seller: I'm actually thinking more along the lines of $28, considering the quality and craftsmanship that's gone into making this belt holster.
	Buyer: I appreciate the details, but I was thinking more along the lines of $20, considering it's a cash-only transaction and I'm on a tight budget.
	Seller: I understand where you're coming from, but considering the genuine leather and high-quality materials used, I'm not sure I can go that low. I'd be willing to do $28, which is already a bit of a discount from the original price.
	Buyer: I'd be willing to do $23, considering I've done my research and it seems to be a fair price given the quality and features of the belt holster.
	Seller: I think we're getting closer, but I'd rather sell it for $32, considering the premium quality and the fact that it's already a discount.
	Buyer: I think we're close, but I can do $25.
	Seller: I can see we're very close, and I think $29 is a fair price considering the premium quality and the fact that it's a one-time cash sale.
	Buyer: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about we do $26?
	Seller: I think we're very close, but I'd rather sell it for $32, considering the premium quality and the fact that it's already a discount.
	Buyer: I think we're getting close, and I'm willing to meet you at $26, but I'd like to make a final offer to see if we can get somewhere closer to my target price.
	Seller: I think we're very close, but I'd rather sell it for $30, considering the premium quality and the fact that it's already a discount.
	Buyer: I can do $23, but that's as low as I can go.

I'm interested in the Bottom Floor, 2 Bd/2 Bth, Large Patio! Can you tell me more about it?
	Seller: It's a fantastic unit, literally on the bottom floor, so you'd have easy access to the patio and plenty of natural light. The layout is perfect for a small household, with two bedrooms and one bathroom. And the kitchen is fully equipped with a range, dishwasher, and microwave.
	Buyer: That sounds great, the fully equipped kitchen would make it easier to manage, and the natural light is a big plus, right?
	Seller: I'd say it's a great deal considering the amenities, but I was thinking more along the lines of $2200, considering the prices in the area and the condition of the unit.
	Buyer: I think $2200 might be a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to consider meeting me at $1800?
	Seller: I understand where you're coming from, but I've already priced it competitively, and I'd need to make up for the wear and tear on the unit. I'd be willing to meet you at $2100, but that's as low as I can go.
	Buyer: Would you be open to meeting me at $1950?
	Seller: I'm still a bit far from your target price, but I can see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $2050?
	Buyer: I was thinking more along the lines of 1800, but 2050 seems reasonable.
	Seller: I can do $2100, that's the lowest I can go, considering the condition of the unit.
	Buyer: I was thinking more along the lines of $1900, considering the wear and tear on the unit.
	Seller: I think we can do $2080, I'm willing to meet you right down the middle with $2050.
	Buyer: I was thinking more along the lines of $1900, considering the wear and tear on the unit.
	Seller: I can do $2080, that's the lowest I can go, considering the condition of the unit.
	Buyer: Would you be willing to consider meeting me at $1905?
