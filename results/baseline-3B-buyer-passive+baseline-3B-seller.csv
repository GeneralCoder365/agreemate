      	Buyer: Hi, thank you for offering the Apple iPhone 5S 16gb Space Gray. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was wondering if we could discuss the price a bit further.
	Seller: Absolutely, the price is something we can discuss. I was thinking more along the lines of $140.
	Buyer: I see, $140 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120?
	Seller: I can do $145, that's as low as I can go, considering the phone's condition is like new and it's a 5S model.
	Buyer: I can do $125, but I think we can both agree that's a fair price considering the phone's condition.
	Seller: How about we do $142.50?
	Buyer: I think we can do $130.
	Seller: I can do $135, but I think we can both agree that's a fair price considering the phone's condition.

      	Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in the 2003 350z. Can you tell me more about it?
	Seller: The 2003 350z has been well-maintained with regular oil changes and maintenance every 3500 miles. It recently received a clutch and flywheel swap 2 months ago, and I also installed a K&N long tube cold air intake with a 5/16 motordyne spacer kit. The car is lowered on Tein springs and has new Michelin A/S sport plus tires installed at 109k miles. I'm looking
	Buyer: That sounds like a great car. I'd love to take a closer look. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8, considering the recent upgrades and maintenance.
	Seller: I can definitely see why you'd think that, but I've just been looking for a work truck and I want to make a good sale, so I think we can meet in the middle around $8,700.
	Buyer: I appreciate the upgrades and maintenance, but $8,700 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Could we talk about meeting somewhere in the middle, say $8,400?
	Seller: I can do $8,550, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.
	Buyer: How about $8,200?
	Seller: I can do $8,500, but I'm looking to make a sale, so I'm open to negotiating in small increments.
	Buyer: How about we meet in the middle at $8,300?
	Seller: I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800, but I can see we're close.
	Buyer: I think we're close, so how about we meet at $8,400?
	Seller: I think we're close, so I'm willing to meet at $8,500.
	Buyer: I think we're really close, how about we meet at $8,425?
	Seller: I think we're really close, how about we meet at $8,425?
	Buyer: Alright, I think we've got a deal. $8,425 it is.
