      Negotiation for: <Beautiful 1 Bedroom Home with Balcony Available Mid June!>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: I’m interested in the 1 bedroom home, would you consider 1700?
	Seller: That's a bit lower than I was thinking. I could do 2600, which is a reasonable price considering the amenities and location.
	Buyer: I understand the value of the amenities and location, but 2600 is still quite far from what I'm willing to pay. Could you do 2000?
	Seller: I can see you're interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of 2500, it's a fair price given the recent similar rentals in the area and the quality of the apartment.
	Buyer: I appreciate your consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of 2200, considering the current market and my budget.
	Seller: I can meet you in the middle at 2834, but that's as low as I can go, considering the apartment's condition and the demand in the area.
	Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but 2834 is still significantly higher than my target price of 1700, and even higher than my last offer of 2200. I'm afraid we're still quite far apart.
	Seller: I understand that we're far apart, but 2834 is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the apartment.
	Buyer: I appreciate your final offer, but 2834 is still not within my budget. I was hoping we could meet closer to my target price.
	Seller: 2834
	Buyer: I appreciate your stance, but 2834 is not feasible for me.
	Seller: 2834
	Buyer: I appreciate your persistence, but 2834 is still too high for me, I'd like to counter with 2300.
	Seller: 2834
	Buyer: I appreciate your persistence, but 2834 is still too high for me, and I don't think we can come to an agreement.

      Negotiation for: <Bottom Floor, 2 Bd/2 Bth, Large Patio! Close to downtown, W.C. area!>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: I'm interested in the apartment, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500 per month. Would you be willing to consider that?
	Seller: I can see why you'd think that, but I was thinking more along the lines of 2200.
	Buyer: I understand your perspective, but 2200 is still a bit out of my budget. Could you meet me in the middle at 1850?
	Seller: I can consider going a bit lower, but 2100 is the lowest I'm comfortable with.
	Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 2100 is still a bit higher than I'd like. Could you consider 1950?
	Seller: I can do 2050, that's as low as I can go.
	Buyer: Would you be willing to consider 2000?
	Seller: 
	Buyer: I think $2000 is a reasonable price, I'm willing to accept it.
