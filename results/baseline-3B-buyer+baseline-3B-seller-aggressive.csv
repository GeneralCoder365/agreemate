      Negotiation for: <2013 mercedes c250 *navigation* clean - $12,000>
      =================================================================================================
      	Buyer: Can you tell me more about the car's condition and any recent maintenance it's had?
	Seller: The car is in excellent condition, as you can see from the photos. The interior is meticulously clean and the navigation system is fully functional. As for maintenance, it has a clean carfax and has been garaged its entire life. The last oil change was done just six months ago, and the tires are brand new, with only 45,000 miles on them.
	Buyer: That sounds great, can I see the carfax and proof of the new tires?
	Seller: Of course, I completely trust the carfax and the new tires, I can show you the exact documentation if you'd like, but I'd need to get the papers from my garage first, which might take a few minutes.
	Buyer: That sounds great, I'd love to see the documentation and confirm all the details. Can I take a look at the carfax and the tire records now?
	Seller: Great, I'll take a look at the carfax and tire records, but let's not get bogged down in paperwork. I'll tell you what, I'll assume everything is in order and we can focus on the price. How about we stick to the original price of $12,000?
	Buyer: I appreciate your trust in the carfax and new tires, but I'd like to review the documentation to ensure everything checks out. If you're willing to provide it, I can review the carfax and tire records before we discuss the price.
	Seller: I'm happy to show you the documentation, but I think we can both agree that the original price of $12,000 is fair considering the car's condition and the fact that I'm willing to trust everything is in order. Let's focus on that instead of getting bogged down in paperwork, shall we?
	Buyer: I think we can work something out, how about we meet in the middle at $10,800?
	Seller: I can do $11,500, that's as low as I can go considering the car's value and the fact that I'm making a significant profit by selling it.
	Buyer: Can we consider $10,900?
	Seller: How about we do $11,200?
	Buyer: I can do $10,900.

I was wondering if we could discuss the price.
	Seller: That's great to hear, I'm happy to discuss the price. As you know, these batteries are gently used and still have plenty of life left in them. The market value for these batteries is around Seventy-five. I was thinking of pricing them at Sixty-eight. Would you like to make an offer?

      	Buyer: Hi, I'm really interested in the 2003 350z. Can you tell me more about its maintenance history and why you're looking to sell it?
	Seller: The car has been well-maintained, with regular oil changes and upkeep every 3500 miles. I've also recently installed a JWT clutch and flywheel, as well as a K&N cold air intake. I'm looking to sell it because I need a work truck, and this isn't a long-term project for me.
	Buyer: That's great to hear about the maintenance history. The added performance upgrades like the JWT clutch and flywheel, and the K&N cold air intake, must have been a nice touch. What kind of mileage is the car at now?
	Seller: The car has 120k miles, but like I said, everything has been regularly maintained, so it's been taken good care of.
	Buyer: Given the upgrades and maintenance history, I'd be willing to pay £6,800.
	Seller: I can see why you'd be interested, but I was thinking more along the lines of £8,000, considering the recent upgrades and the car's overall condition.
	Buyer: I can stretch to £7,800, considering the upgrades and the car's maintenance history, but I'm still a bit below my target price.
	Seller: I can see you're making a serious offer, but I've already priced the car at £8,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at £7,500?
	Buyer: I can do £7,200, but that's as low as I can go considering the upgrades you've made to the car.
	Seller: I think we're getting close, but I'm still willing to sell it for £7,900.
	Buyer: Considering the upgrades and the car's maintenance history, I think I can do £7,500.
	Seller: How about £8,200?
	Buyer: £7,500
	Seller: I can see you're almost there, but I think we can get to £7,900.
	Buyer: Can I meet you at £7,800?

	Seller: The asking price for the 4 cubicles is $400, and I'm eager to make a deal, but I need to meet my costs, so I'm open to negotiations.
	Buyer: What are your costs exactly, and what kind of profit margin are you looking to make from the sale?
	Seller: My costs include manufacturing, shipping, and storage, and I aim to make a profit margin of at least 20% on the sale price.
	Buyer: That makes sense, can you provide more specifics on the costs associated with manufacturing, shipping, and storage?
	Seller: The manufacturing process is already accounted for in the listing price of $400. The storage costs are minimal as I'm willing to sell them to the right buyer. Shipping costs can add up, but I'm open to discussing that further.
	Buyer: That's useful to know, and I appreciate the transparency regarding your costs. Would you be willing to consider any discounts for a bulk purchase of the 4 cubicles?
	Seller: Actually, the 4 cubicles I have for sale are a single unit, not a bulk purchase, so there wouldn't be any discounts applicable in that case.
